Landscapes in population genetics: ecology, evolution, conservation, and simulation

Abstract:
Populations live, reproduce, and interact across heterogeneous
landscapes, and the resulting diverse evolutionary pressures affect
the landscapes of genetic diversity along each species' genome. In
this talk, I'll discuss some known results and open questions about
how heterogeneous environments affect diversity, show some relevant
genome-wide diversity data, and explain how computer simulation might
help us resolve these questions. Along the way, I will present recent
algorithmic advances in spatial population genetic simulation, which
promises to have applications in applied ecology and conservation
genetics as well.
